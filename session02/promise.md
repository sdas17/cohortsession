# what is promise
promise who have return some thing future


A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value 
function main(){

}
settime(main ,1000)
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations more effectively than traditional callback functions providing a cleaner and more manageable way to deal with code that executes asynchronously, such as API calls, file I/O, or timers.
 

 setTimeout(2000).then(main);
